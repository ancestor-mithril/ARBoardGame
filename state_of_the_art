### History of AR

You can check here a [short history of AR](https://www.blippar.com/blog/2018/06/08/history-augmented-reality#:~:text=2000%3A%20AR%20Quake%20launched%20%2D%20the%20first%20AR%20game.) but in this document we will focus on AR board games.

Although Wikipedia claims one of the oldest AR game is [Cybergeneration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybergeneration).

### AR Works

Even though Tendary says it was the first board game in AR, board-game-like applications were developed before them. AR Works is a company that develops VR and AR app support. They have built medical and industrial AR applications, and in 2017 they made a game that you could play on a huge board outside: the Milka game.

### Tilt Five

Tilt is a new project that allows users to play in Augumentred Reality. They provide a package of 3 items: glasses, an AR wand, and a board. It works with special glasses that have two small projectors which overlay an image over the lents. The board is the place all the games are rendered onto. The wand can interact with the AR objects or can be used to point in the virtual scene.
